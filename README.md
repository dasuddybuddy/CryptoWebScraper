# CryptoWebScraper

This is a python based webscraper used to scrape the top 100 cryptos from https://coinmarketcap.com/coins/ using playwright. It collects information trading volume, market caps, and prices of top 100 coins and stores it into a PostgreSQL database, allowing for easy access to viewers, updating data everytime code is ran. Planning on making a user friendly dashboard and AI predictions.
